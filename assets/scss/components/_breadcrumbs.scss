// Breadcrumb specific styling
// This file can now be simplified as the core styling is handled by the main stylesheet.
// We just need to ensure the parent <a> doesn't get an underline itself.
a.breadcrumb-link-parent {
  text-decoration-line: none !important;
}

// The .breadcrumb-link-text will be automatically styled by the rules in _typography-custom.scss
