> <h4>Online Sessions, Tailored to You</h4><p>All sessions are conducted online and scheduled directly with your mentor for convenience and flexibility. You can choose to work with the same mentor for continuity, or connect with different mentors based on your evolving needs and application stage.</p>

> <h4>Actionable, Honest Feedback</h4><p>Mentors provide candid, hands-on support, strengthen your narrative, helping you refine your essays, and approach every stage of your application with confidence.</p>

> <h4>Guidance That Goes Beyond Getting In</h4><p> Stay connected beyond your admission through our peer and alumni network, with ongoing academic and career guidance. Successful applicants are encourages to return as mentors, fostering the circle of shared support and growth.</p>

## Mentor Network
We currently work with over 65+ mentors from diverse academic backgrounds and geographies. All mentors are selected not only for their expertise but also for their commitment to the values of the Application Lab: access, empathy, and clarity.

Each mentor undergoes basic training and adheres to our ethical guidelines. Mentors are matched with students based on academic discipline, region/university of interest, and mentorship goals. We are building a pay-it-forward model where past mentees who successfully secure offers return to mentor future applicants, creating a self-sustaining and dynamic community.
