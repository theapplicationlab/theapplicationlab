## Mentor Network
We currently work with over 65+ mentors from diverse academic backgrounds and geographies. All mentors are selected not only for their expertise but also for their commitment to the values of the Application Lab: access, empathy, and clarity.

Each mentor undergoes basic training and adheres to our ethical guidelines. Mentors are matched with students based on academic discipline, region/university of interest, and mentorship goals. We are building a pay-it-forward model where past mentees who successfully secure offers return to mentor future applicants, creating a self-sustaining and dynamic community.
